We can see that there are more magnet schools than JJ schools. Also, there are only 8 JJ schools and 52 Magnet schools out of 1000.

The pivot table shows us that the distribution of genders among magnet schools is almost equal. However in JJ schools, male student ratio is much higher with almost 85%.

If we compare the overall population of the United States, broken down by race and gender (Wikipedia U.S. race demography page) with our results; our findings showed that there are less white students enrolled, with approximately %24 white females and 26% white males. This is because Wikipedia page considers Hispanic as "Two or more races" whereas we considered it as one race. Thus our findings on white race percentage is different.
